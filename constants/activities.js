	description:
		"I possess a deep passion for programming contests, which has led me to participate in an extensive array of online and team-based onsite competitions, numbering in the hundreds, throughout my academic years. Despite the passage of time, I remain keenly interested and actively seek out opportunities to participate whenever feasible. My mastery of proper data structures and algorithms has allowed me to successfully solve over 1500 diverse problems on various online judges. By consistently meeting time and space constraints, I have honed my problem-solving abilities and expanded my perspective in a way that enables me to tackle real-world software development challenges with greater creativity and efficacy.",
